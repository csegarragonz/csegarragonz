### Carlos Segarra's Github Home

I am a PhD student at the Imperial College in London.
My interests cover systems and security, with a focus on serverless and confidential computing.

Here's a selection of some projects I am working on:
* [Faasm](https://github.com/faasm/faasm) - high-performance serverless runtime with WebAssembly.
* [TLess](https://github.com/faasm/tless) - anonymous and composable attestation for confidential serverless.
* [GRANNY](https://github.com/faasm/granny-experiments) - granular management of compute-intensive applications in the cloud.
* [sc2](https://github.com/sc2-sys) - confidential serverless with confidential containers.
