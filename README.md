### Carlos Segarra's Github Home

I am a PhD student at the Imperial College in London.
My interests cover systems and security, with a focus on privacy-preserving runtimes and confidential computing.

Here's a selection of some projects I am working on:
* [Faasm](https://github.com/faasm/faasm) - high-performance serverless runtime with WebAssembly.
* [TLess](https://github.com/faasm/faasm/tree/tless) - port of the Faasm runtime for confidential serverless computing.
* [cc-DSB](https://github.com/lsds/cc-DeathStarBench) - port of the DeathStar benchmark for microservices to a confidential computing setting.
* [CoCo-Serverless](https://github.com/coco-serverless) - confidential serverless with confidential containers.
