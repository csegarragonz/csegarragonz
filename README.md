### Carlos Segarra's Github Home

I am a PhD student at the Imperial College in London working on systems and security.
My interests cover systems and security, with a focus on privacy-preserving runtimes and confidential computing.

Here's a selection of some projects I am working on:
* [Faasm](https://github.com/faasm/faasm) - high-performance serverless runtime with WebAssembly.
* [TLess](https://github.com/faasm/faasm/tree/tless) - port of the Faasm runtime for confidential serverless computing.
